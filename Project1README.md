For this project I had to intake an input file, (of format .txt) and go through the list of dates in YYYYMMDD format. 
In the input file, the dates could either be separated by a comma on the same line, each on a new line, or both. 
I then had to create a Graphical User Interface that had two side panels, outputting the list as it came in one side, 
and sorting the dates in chronological order on the other side.
